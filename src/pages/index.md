      Hacking on projects and playing around with new tech are some of my favorite things to do. For example: I started
      this website not only because I wanted a place and reason to document my findings, but also because I was interested
      in playing around with Gatsby.js and JSON resume (which I ended up contributing to). 

      I get the most excited about projects that involve a bit of product management and engineering, so you'll find that
      most of the blog posts here will be about engineering projects through the lens of the user/customer.
